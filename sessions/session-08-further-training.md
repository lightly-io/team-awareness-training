# Session #8 - Further training

In this final session, the group will discuss how to carry on their own training after the course ends and evaluate the course.

## Setup
1. [Sharing](#1-sharing): reflections on well-being. (10 min)
2. [Teaching](#2-what-happens-now): training after the course ends. (20 min)
3. [Method](#3-a-final-meditation-session): final meditation session. (20 min)
4. [Reflection](#4-reflection. (10 min)

The teacher should note all key findings and questions in the session, and make sure to follow up on them in the email afterwards.

## 1. Sharing
Take turns clock-wise around the table and reflect on the previous week. How did you experience writing gratitude lists? Did you try savoring any moments? Could you use it in your meditation practice?

Gratitude feels weird for many in the beginning, but just like the other exercises it’s results come from doing it over a long period of time. And most importantly: actually doing it. It’s not enought to passively think about gratitude from time to time.

## 2. What happens now?
After this session, the course is over.

It’s been eight weeks which mirrors most of the science done on meditation. After eight weeks, you should be able to feel different in a lot of ways. But was it worth it? Perhaps there is some other activity that would give the same result.

Some participants want to explore the philosophical parts of meditation more. How does it relate to the idea of Self, when it’s obvious that I am not the one in charge of my thoughts. Or what’s this idea behind impermanence, where we notice that everything seems to come and go. Or perhaps even non-duality: that we want the bad stuff in our life because otherwise the good would not be able to be good.

Others look at it from a self-help perspective. And others as a productivity tool. Help each person find their own strategy for moving forward with meditation in what way that seems to inspire them most.

And remember to anchor your teachings to the group and the organisation. How can we spread a sense of calm and focus to the people around us?

It’s a good method to start every meditation session out with that question. It increases our motivation.

## 3. A final meditation session
Meditate together.

Answer any of the groups final questions.

## 4. Reflection
Let the group know that there will be an anonymous feedback form send out.

Take turns counter-clockwise to reflect on the course. Was it a good investment of time? What did we learn, really? Has it affected work or even our private lives in any ways? Is there anything in the course that should be updated before it’s done again?

Let each participant talk until they're finished. Answer any questions that might come up, and note those you don't have an answer for.

After the round, tell the group that you will be staying afterwards to answer any questions that you didn't have time to discuss during the session or that they would like to ask 1-on-1. 

Thank them for their time and attention.

## Extra material
- Tell the group what you’ve learned as a teacher. Retell any moments during the course that’s been especially interesting to you. Try to be as specific as possible. If there is anything you are grateful for, now is a good time to say that.
- Remember that meditation is not special. It’s easy to become preachy once you’ve find something that works for you. But meditation is not the answer. For someone else, mountain biking is just as effective.
- Try to summarize the message of the course. Prioritize mental training and methods to increase calm and focus - because it will make the rest of your work so much better. When creativity and clarity is close at hand, we don’t need productivity hacks.
