# Session #2 - Meditation

In this session, participants will learn what meditation is, how to meditate, what happens in the body and brain when you meditate and some philosophical elements of the practice.

## Setup
1. [Sharing](#1-sharing): reflections on previous week. (10 min)
2. [Teaching](#2-teaching-meditation): meditation. (20 min)
3. [Method](#3-method-meditation): meditation. (20 min)
4. [Reflection](#4-reflection): reflection on meditation. (10 min)

As a teacher, note all key findings and questions during the session. Make sure to follow up on them in the email afterwards.

## 1. Sharing
Take turns clock-wise around the table and reflect on the previous week. How has your experience of deep breathing been? Was it hard? Easy? Nice? Uncomfortable? Was it hard to find the time to do it? Did you notice anything different in stressful situations?

Make sure to let every person talk until they're finished. There's no need to rush them. Answer any questions, but try not to steer their reflection.

Note that mental training works like physical training. Results are related to input and effort. If the group has trouble finding the time to do their homework, try helping them out. Is it easier at home or at work? On the commute? During breaks? 

If the group works in the same building they can set up a daily session together. Just book a conference room, meet up and do the exercises.

It's not your job to make them feel bad for not doing the homework. Point out how important it is and coach them to make it happen.

## 2. Teaching: meditation
Meditation is an umbrella term. Everything from journaling and thinking to spiritual exercises have been called meditation. A definition could be: techniques that are used to discover, develop and express mental states.

In it's simplest form, meditation is just being aware of your inner and outer state. An active meditation means that you make a pro-active effort to stay aware. As soon as you notice yourself drifting into a daydream, you let that daydream go and once again become aware of the present moment.

There are many variants of meditations. Some tell you to focus on an image, some on a word (mantra). Some meditations are done in motion, like walking meditation and tai chi, while most are done sitting still.

Now, we can use meditation as a spiritual method - to understand the transcendental. That's not what we're going to do in this course. Just like you see people singing in church, that doesn't mean all singing is religious. Right?

There have been a lot of studies done on meditation in the last couple of years showing that it can lower stress levels and increase focus. Why is that? Well, the stress part is kind of simple. By sitting still and not doing anything, you're letting thoughts and worry drift away. 

There are, however, better methods to handle stress. If you just want to lower stress, science seems to point to physical exercise and sleep as more important than meditation. But for many, these things are not enough, or perhaps impossible.

Meditation is much more than just stress management. It is a tool to discover and develop mental states.

## 3. Method: meditation
Teach the basic meditation method:
- Sit with a straight back.
- Close your eyes.
- Notice the breath moving in and out through your nose.
- As soon as you start daydreaming, bring your focus back to the breath moving in and out.

Try it out for a minute or so. Ask the group what their experience was like.

Most will notice a million thoughts whirling throught their minds. At this point, the group needs to be reassured that this is not a problem. It happens for everyone. Others will feel restlessness. Tell them this is common, and not a problem. They're just supposed to notice the restlessness. Where in the body does it present itself?

Try meditation again, but now for a longer period of time. At every minute or so, tell the participants that everything is OK. Even restlessness and daydreaming. Ask them to bring their focus back to the breath as soon as they notice the drift in attention.

Their **homework** from this point on is to do meditation for ten minutes, twice daily. A success is sitting down for the entire session and bringing your attention back at least once.

## 4. Reflection
Take turns to reflect on the meditation experience. Let each participant talk until they're finished. Answer any questions that might come up, and note those you don't have an answer for.

After the round, tell the group that you will be staying afterwards. Both to answer any questions that you didn't have time to discuss during the session and those they would like to ask 1-on-1.

## Extra material
- This meditation practice can either be called mindfulness meditation or vipassana (insight) meditation.
- It might help to start the meditation out by doing some deep breathing.
- Counting to ten instead of focusing on your breath is just another method, and the participants should be able to pick whatever fits them best. Some like mantras, some like visualization.
- It's fine just sitting on a chair. If you're sleepy, try not to rest your back on the back support.
- Laying down, however, puts most people to sleep.
